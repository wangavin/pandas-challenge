# Conclusions in passing Score and funding support:
Base on collect student Passing data of Math and Reading result, we can See less student class in small size school of easy learning of Math and English. 

**Point of view in Charter school:**

*   Teacher has more time to take care of student and teaching is often more innovative in charter schools.
*   Less student class can be easy to get student focus in the class.
*   Charter school have their freedom create their math and reading course for student learning.
*   Charter school can dedicate increased resources and energy on supporting students in excelling academic standards.
*   Charter schools provide enrichment opportunities. 
*   Charter school less student, they can focus funding how to use for student.  Reduce wasting funding in the unnecessary education direction.

**Point of view in District school:** 

*   Most District School have lots of student. Teacher don't have enough time take care all student in the class.
*   Because of too many students take care, district school is hard to pool resources to help student.
*   District school have follow Education Bureau overall design course to teach all student. It limited teacher freedom to take care other students special support in Math or English.
*   District school lack of guidance from the Education Bureau.
*   District school have based on Education Bureau instruct, hard to use resources to help student.

## Suggestion for passing score raise and funding:
*   District school can refer to Charter school study method and education courses.
*   Develop less student in small class.
*   We can reduce funding in District school and use this funding apply newer teacher or build new school.
*   Allow District school to have more flexible to use funding.
*   If you concern funding using incorrect, we can ask District school provide proposal to Education Bureau
*   We can re-draw sub-education regions and move lots of student in District school to other less student District school, let teacher have more focus to student.
*   Re-draw sub-education regions can easy Education Bureau funding to all District school.
